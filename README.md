## 1. Core Vulnerability & Overview

This toolkit exploits a security vulnerability found in certain Lenovo Android tablets. These devices have firmware signed with publicly available **AOSP (Android Open Source Project) test keys**.

Because of this vulnerability, the device's bootloader trusts and boots any image signed with these common test keys, even if the bootloader is **locked**.

This toolkit is an all-in-one collection of scripts that leverages this flaw to perform advanced modifications on a device with a locked bootloader.

### Target Models

* Lenovo Legion Y700 2nd, 3rd, 4th Gen (aka Legion Tab)
* Lenovo Yoga Pad Pro AI (aka Yoga Tab Plus AI)
* Lenovo Xiaoxin Pad Pro GT (aka Yoga Tab 11.1 AI)
* *...Other recent Lenovo devices (released in 2023 or later with Qualcomm chipsets) may also be vulnerable.*

## 2. How to Use

The toolkit is designed to be fully automated.

1.  **Download & Extract:** Download the latest release and extract it to a folder (ensure the path contains no spaces or non-ASCII characters).
2.  **Run the Script:** Double-click **`start.bat`**.
    * *Dependencies will be installed automatically on the first run.*
3.  **Select Task:** Follow the on-screen menu to choose your desired operation.

## 3. Menu Descriptions

### 3.1 Main Menu

**`1. Install firmware [WIPE DATA]`**
The all-in-one automated task. It performs all steps (Convert, XML Prepare, Dump, Patch, ARB Check, Flash) and **wipes all user data**.

**`2. Update firmware [KEEP DATA]`**
Same as option 1, but modifies the XML scripts to **preserve user data** (skips `userdata` and `metadata` partitions).

**`3. Rescue after OTA`**
Attempts to fix boot issues caused by taking a Full OTA update on a converted device by dumping & patching essential partitions.

**`4. Disable OTA`**
Connects to the device in ADB mode and disables system update packages to prevent automatic updates.

**`5. Root device`**
Opens the root selection menu:
* **LKM Mode:** Patches `init_boot.img` & `vbmeta.img` (Recommended for newer kernels). Supports Magisk, KernelSU Next and SukiSU.
* **GKI Mode:** Patches `boot.img` by replacing its kernel with [GKI_KernelSU_SUSFS](https://github.com/WildKernels/GKI_KernelSU_SUSFS).

**`6. Unroot device`**
Restores the device to a non-rooted state by flashing the stock image from backups.

**`7. Sign & Flash Custom Recovery`**
Signs a custom recovery image (e.g., TWRP) with test keys and flashes it to the recovery partition.

**`0. Settings`**
Opens the settings submenu to configure the toolkit (see below).

### 3.2 Settings Menu

* **Region:** Toggle target firmware region between **PRC** (China) and **ROW** (Global).
* **Skip ADB:** Toggle ADB checks. Useful if the device is already in EDL/Fastboot mode.
* **Skip Anti-Rollback:** Toggle automated Anti-Rollback checks.
* **Language:** Switch the toolkit's interface language.
* **Check for Updates:** Check for the latest version of LTBox.

### 3.3 Advanced Menu

Individual steps for manual control and troubleshooting.

**`1. Convert ROM Region`**
Converts `vendor_boot.img` and rebuilds `vbmeta.img` based on the selected region settings.

**`2. Dump devinfo/persist from device`**
Dumps `devinfo` and `persist` partitions from the device in EDL mode to the `backup/` folder.

**`3. Patch devinfo/persist`**
Patches the country code (e.g., "CN", "KR") in `devinfo.img`/`persist.img`.

**`4. Write devinfo/persist to device`**
Flashes the patched images to the device via EDL.

**`5. Detect Anti-Rollback from device`**
Dumps `boot` and `vbmeta_system` to check their rollback indices against the new ROM.

**`6. Patch rollback indices in ROM`**
Synchronizes the new ROM's rollback index with the device's index to bypass anti-rollback protection.

**`7. Write Anti-Anti-Rollback patched image`**
Flashes the ARB-patched images to the device.

**`8. Convert X files to XML`**
Decrypts `.x` (encrypted) firmware files into `.xml` files.

**`9. Modify XML for Flashing [WIPE DATA]`**
Generates `rawprogram` XMLs to allow flashing patched images and **wipes user data**.

**`10. Modify XML for Flashing [KEEP DATA]`**
Same as Step 9, but modifies XMLs to **preserve user data**.

**`11. Flash firmware to device`**
Manual full flash. Copies all patched files and flashes them using `fh_loader`.

**`12. Clean workspace`**
Deletes all temporary output folders and files. Backups are preserved.

## 4. Other Utilities

**`info_image.bat`**
Drag and drop `.img` files or folders onto this script to extract detailed image information using avbtool.
